 * For any positive integer n, define μ(n) as the sum of the primitive nth roots of unity.
 * It has values in {−1, 0, 1} depending on the factorization of n into prime factors:
 *   μ(n) = +1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.
 *   μ(n) = −1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.
 *   μ(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.

 * returns -1 when number has odd number of prime factors
 * @param {Integer} number
