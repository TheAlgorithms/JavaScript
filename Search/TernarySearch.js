/* Ternary search is similar to binary search but it divides the sorted array
 * into three parts and determines which part the key lies in. The array will
 * be divided into three intervals by using two middle points, mid1 and mid2.
 * The value of the key will first be compared with the two mid points, the value
 * will be returned if there is a match. Then, if the value of the key is less
 * than mid1, narrow the interval to the first part. Else, if the value of the
 * key is greater than mid2, narrow the interval to the third part. Otherwise,
 * narrow the interval to the middle part. Repeat the steps until the value is
 * found or the interval is empty (value not found after checking all elements).
