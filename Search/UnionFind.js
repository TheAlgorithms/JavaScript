 * union find data structure for javascript
 *
 * In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set,
 * is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition
 * of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union),
 * and finding a representative member of a set.
 * The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same or different sets.
 *
 * Disjoint-set data structures play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
 * The importance of minimum spanning trees means that disjoint-set data structures underlie a wide variety of algorithms.
 * In addition, disjoint-set data structures also have applications to symbolic computation, as well in compilers,
 * especially for register allocation problems.
 *
 * you can learn more on disjoint-set / union–find data structure at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure
 * @param {number} n The number of distinct groups to initialize the Union Find data structure.
 * @param {function(number): number} [key] Optional key function that maps indices of groups. Default is the identity function.
