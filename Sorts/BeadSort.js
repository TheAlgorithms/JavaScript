/**
 * Bead Sort, also known as Gravity sort.
 *
 * This algorithm was inspired from natural phenomena and was designed keeping in mind objects (or beads) falling under
 * the influence of gravity.
 *
 * NOTE: It only works for arrays of positive integers.
 *
 * Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_sort
 * @param {number[]} sequence An array of positive integers to be sorted.
 * @returns {number[]} Returns a sorted array of positive integers.
 * @throws {RangeError} Throws a RangeError if the input sequence contains any negative integers.
