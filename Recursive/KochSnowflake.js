/**
 * The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described.
 *
 * The Koch snowflake can be built up iteratively, in a sequence of stages. The first stage is an equilateral triangle,
 * and each successive stage is formed by adding outward bends to each side of the previous stage, making smaller
 * equilateral triangles. This can be achieved through the following steps for each line:
 * 1. divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.
 * 2. draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.
 * 3. remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.
 *
 * (description adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)
 * (for a more detailed explanation and an implementation in the Processing language, see
 * https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/ #84-the-koch-curve-and-the-arraylist-technique).
